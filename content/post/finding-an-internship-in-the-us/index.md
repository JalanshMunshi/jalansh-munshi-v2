# Who is this post for? 

How to get an internship after coming to the US? When should I start applying for internships? What's important for my resume so that I can land an interview? 

If you are someone who has similar questions in your mind, then I highly recommend reading the entire post as it will greatly help you to pave a path for yourself when you start the internship hunt. 

# Who the hell am I to present my views about finding an internship? 

Finding an internship is something that I have struggled with and I reached out to many people for guidance. Ideal time for applying, how to prepare, how do I get past the ATS, et cetera. Whatever advices I received, I followed them and I was successful in landing multiple interviews and offers. This makes me qualified enough to present my experiences in the hope that someone can benefit from them in the future. 

And while we are at it, it will also save me a lot of time to just forward this post instead of arranging for a call everytime a friend needs to ask this, haha! 

Jokes apart, let's get down to business! 

1. A brief overview about the whole post.
2. Why do I qualify to write this post - talk about the previous interviews.
3. Which things do I feel are important for getting an interview?
4. What to do if you don't have them.
5. Resources for finding open positions - CS careers, GitHub repo. 
6.
