# Who is this post for? 

How to get an internship in the US? When should I start applying for internships? What's important for my resume so that I can land an interview? 

If you are someone who has similar questions in your mind, then I highly recommend reading the entire post as it will greatly help you to pave a path for yourself when you start the internship hunt. 

I have written this post for Software Engineering internships for US-based roles. However, I believe that many bits and pieces of this post can help any student in any country. 

# Who the hell am I to present my views about finding an internship? 

Finding an internship is something that I have struggled with and I reached out to many people for guidance. Ideal time for applying, how to prepare, how do I get past the ATS, et cetera. I ended up receiving interview invitations to multiple companies MNCs and startups) and landed multiple internship offers. I feel that this makes me qualified enough to present my experiences so that someone can benefit from them in the future. 

And while we are at it, it will also save me a lot of time to just forward this post instead of arranging for a call everytime a friend needs to ask this, haha! 

Jokes apart, let's get down to business! 

# Before you start applying...

It is always a good idea to have a roadmap inside your mind about what you have to do before applying for internships. This usually revolves around building your resume, practising algorithmic programing, or doing some side project that may look good on your resume. Let's talk about resume first. 

## Resume

Resume is a crucial part of any internship or job application. It defines who you are and what you bring to the table. It is very important to highlight your previous experiences and your expected graduation date on your resume. Recruiters usually look for these 2 things on your resume and then have a look at the rest of it. I learnt this from a couple of recruiters. Not my personal whim. Apart from your experiences, you can mention some projects that you may have done. Projects can be academic or personal. 

It does matter how you present the information on your resume. Try to sound like an achiever instead of a doer. This is precisely what I received as feedback from one of the persons I got my resume reviewed with. Be a humblebrag. If possible, ask your friend, or brother/sister to review your resume for some grammatical mistakes or for the content. 

## Building your profile

At least for opportunities in the US, I have realised that being good at just algorithmic programing is not enough to get interview calls. Sooner or later, you will definitely get an interview call from some company, but there will always be someone who is good at algorithmic programing and also knows some other piece of technology or has prior experience, which you don't. You have got to stand out! It does not matter if you have a black belt or a master on some platform on some random platform for competitve programming. Being good at basic algorithmic programming is enough. It does make a difference if you have software engineering experience apart from algorithmic programming. It gives . 

Doing some extra projects while learning a new technology, contributing to Open Source Software (OSS), participating in Hackathons are some ways that can help you to build your overall profile. Not only these will make your profile stronger, but they will also give the interviewer more topics to ask during the interview. More the experience or number of interesting projects you have, more the chances of the interviewer asking questions about them and not just a random leetcode question. 

# Okay, now what? 

{{< figure src="the-hobbit-image.png" title="Image credit: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/1ce5wt/this_was_my_moment_where_i_smiled_really_widely/)" >}}

To put in extremely simple terms, find as many opportunities as you can and apply as soon as you can. July end or August first week is usually a good time to start applying for internships. 

## How do I find the opportunities? 

The best place I went to for finding any new postings was [this public repository](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2022-Internships) mainitained by the Computer Science Club of University of Pittsburgh. This repository is actively updated by people all over the US and Canada. 

Apart from that, you can find tons of opportunities on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), [Untapped](https://www.untapped.io) (previously Canvas) and many others. 

## Network!

Networking is really important when it comes to applying for new opportunities at any point of your career. Along with applying for open positions, I would also recommend anyone to register for webinars hosted by companies as it may lead to a connection with a recruiter and can potentially land you an interview opportunity. This is how I got in touch with a recruiter from Apple and got an offer to intern at Adobe. You can find more about the Adobe gig [here](https://jalanshmunshi.com/post/adobe-summer-internship-interview-experience/). 

Reaching out to people before your interview will also help you with your preparation. I used [cscareers.dev](https://www.cscareers.dev/) for reaching out to people who have interviewed for a company with who I had an interivew scheduled. The discord server of [cscareers.dev](https://www.cscareers.dev/) was quite handy for this purpose and gave me a direction for my preparation. 

# I got an interview!

That's great news! Now you have the opportunity to show the real person behind the resume. Usually, companies take up to two interviews for internships. 

The interviews revolve around questions related to your previous experience or projects, typical LeetCode questions, and basic CS concepts such as database, operating systems etc. You may also be asked questions related to a technology stack that you may have mentioned on your resume. As far as LeetCode questions are concerned, you can expect an easy or medium question in most interviews. By the time I started applying for internships, I had solved 600+ questions on LeetCode and only 7.5% of them were Hard questions.
