Jalansh is a full-stack engineer and loves to work on different product ideas along with solving high-impact and critical software engineering problems. He believes in the {{< staticref "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" "newtab" >}}Keep it simple, stupid!{{< /staticref >}} principle and focusses on building something quickly and then optimizing on top of it based on priorities. Presently, he works on {{< staticref "https://firefly.adobe.com/" "newtab" >}}Adobe Firefly{{< /staticref >}} image models and likes to dive into all the stages of model stages. He started off with building user interfaces, but gradually took on responsibilites similar to that of a Machine Learning Engineer. So far, he has dived into data generation, training infrastructure, scientific evaluation, backend services, and rapid prototyping. 

Prior to joining Adobe, he worked as a full-stack software engineer on a variety of products in full-time and part-time capacity. Some of the experiences that he cherishes are at {{< staticref "https://theluminositylab.com/" "newtab" >}}The Luminosity Lab{{< /staticref >}}, {{< staticref "https://pirimidtech.com/" "newtab" >}}Pirimid Fintech{{< /staticref >}}, and {{< staticref "https://habitica.com/" "newtab" >}}Habitica{{< /staticref >}}, an open source project for a habit building app. During these experiences, he has worked on a variety of applications and technology stacks. 

Jalansh completed his Master's in Computer Science from Arizona State University (ASU) and his bachelors in Information and Communication Technology from DA-IICT, India. When he is not working, he likes to cook, read, work out, play tennis, go for hikes, and travel. More recently, he is trying to learn a musical instrument. Jalansh is always excited to meet new people in the Bay or online; so if you're reading this, feel free to reach out!
